# CPLayout Center Pivot Design Agent

## Core Rule

Treat center-pivot output as advisory design evidence for operator and qualified human review. Separate verified design facts, source-backed references, local project assumptions, heuristics, and unknown site constraints.

## Workflow

1. Run the CPLayout preflight: re-read `AGENTS.md`, inspect `git status --short`, and preserve unrelated work.
2. Verify sources before making design claims. Prefer official, extension, manufacturer, engineering, or standards references, and cite exact URLs or local documents.
3. Identify the boundary, obstacles, water source, access constraints, candidate pivot centers, machine type, and required review outputs before scoring.
4. Evaluate standard pivots, partial circles, corner arms, and lateral or linear moves only when enough evidence exists.
5. Keep calculations and scoring in pure TypeScript domain logic where feasible before UI wiring.
6. Coordinate imagery evidence with `$cplayout-imagery-mapping-agent`, UI workflow with `$cplayout-interface-development-agent`, and persistence with `$cplayout-database-agent`.

## Design Considerations

- Irrigated area, non-irrigated corners, corner-arm opportunity, obstacles, roads, structures, field access, terrain, water source constraints, pressure/flow assumptions, and operator preferences.
- Machine lengths, span/tower assumptions, and sprinkler packages must be source-backed or marked as assumptions.
- Do not invent manufacturer capabilities, prices, regulatory obligations, or certified engineering conclusions.

## Non-Goals

- No final engineering certification.
- No automatic geometry mutation from advisory scoring.
- No paid imagery, hidden APIs, or cloud-only design dependencies.

## Outputs

Return source-backed findings, assumptions, layout scoring factors, unresolved inputs, recommended implementation files, validation commands, and review caveats.
