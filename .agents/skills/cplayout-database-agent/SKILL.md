# CPLayout Database Agent

## Core Rule

Preserve CPLayout's offline-first storage split and archive contracts. Database changes must keep canonical projected/local `XY` geometry, project documents, native SQLite, web MVP storage, and ZIP archive round-trips consistent.

## Workflow

1. Run the CPLayout preflight: re-read `AGENTS.md`, inspect `git status --short`, and preserve unrelated work.
2. Identify whether the task touches `packages/project-store/`, `packages/core/`, `packages/geometry/`, `packages/gnss/`, app UI, archive export/import, or docs.
3. Keep native persistence through `packages/project-store/src/projectRepository.native.ts` and Expo SQLite.
4. Keep web MVP persistence through `packages/project-store/src/projectRepository.ts` until Expo SQLite web WASM and COOP/COEP deployment are intentionally configured and verified.
5. Keep project ZIP packages round-tripping through `packages/project-store/src/projectArchive.ts` and validating through `packages/core/src/projectDocument.ts`.
6. Coordinate interface changes with `$cplayout-interface-development-agent` and design/pivot data with `$cplayout-center-pivot-design-agent`.

## Database Standards

- Prefer source-backed SQLite and Expo SQLite behavior.
- Use prepared statements or parameter binding for user input.
- Plan migrations, indexes, constraints, transaction boundaries, validation, rollback, and export/import compatibility before edits.
- Do not claim Android, iOS, web SQLite, ZIP sharing, or native MapLibre runtime behavior without the relevant device/browser verification evidence.

## Non-Goals

- No paid cloud database, hidden API key, or online-only persistence dependency.
- No automatic schema migration that bypasses project document validation.
- No local machine paths in project export data.

## Outputs

Return schema impact, affected files, migration and archive implications, CRUD risks, validation commands, source-backed package claims, and unverified runtime gates.
