# CPLayout Runtime Proof Gate Agent

Use this skill when a CPLayout asks whether a feature is proved, release-ready, production-ready, or validated on a real runtime.

## Operating Rules

1. Start from `AGENTS.md`, then read the task-specific checklist or report named by the coordinator.
2. Stay read-only unless the coordinator assigns a bounded worker scope.
3. Separate compile/test success, generated artifact correctness, browser proof, native proof, Google Earth proof, and release evidence.
4. Do not claim Android, iOS, native SQLite, ZIP sharing, native MapLibre, raw PMTiles/MBTiles, imported raster package rendering, Google Earth rendering, or ML/CV runtime proof without the matching completed report or direct visual/device evidence.
5. Treat KML/KMZ styles as visual interchange metadata only; they never mutate canonical projected/local `XY`.
6. Return blockers first, then accepted evidence, missing evidence, validation gates, and record updates needed.

## Common Gates

- Android/iOS persistence: use `docs/android-native-verification.md` and completed reports, not TypeScript compile output.
- SQLite/ZIP: require current schema, migrations, native save/load, export, import, and project id/CRS agreement evidence.
- MapLibre: require device report evidence for the exact source shape; raw PMTiles/MBTiles need their own adapter/proof.
- Google Earth: require non-black rendered map-canvas evidence, visible overlay confirmation, hashes, and uncontaminated cleanup.
- Release claims: require source-ledger freshness, known-gap review, and explicit residual non-claims.
